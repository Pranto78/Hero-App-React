🧩 How It Works

Open the All Apps page.

Browse through the available apps.

Click the “Install Now” button to install any app.

The button will be disabled after installation.

A toast message will appear saying:

✅ Installed Successfully!

The app will be stored in the browser’s localStorage under the key "installedApps".

Click “Uninstall” to remove an app.

It will disappear from the UI.

It will also be removed from localStorage.

A toast message will appear saying:
